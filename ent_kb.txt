What should I do if I have ear pain without a fever?|||Ear pain without fever is often caused by earwax buildup, mild infections, or pressure changes. Over-the-counter pain relievers and keeping the ear dry may help. If pain lasts more than 48 hours, consult an ENT specialist.
I feel like my ear is blocked after swimming. What should I do?|||Water trapped in the ear can cause a blocked sensation. Try tilting your head, pulling your earlobe, or using over-the-counter ear drops. If it persists beyond 24 hours, you should see a doctor.
I have ringing in my ears (tinnitus). Should I be concerned?|||Tinnitus is common and can be due to loud noise exposure, age-related hearing loss, or earwax. If it is persistent, worsening, or affecting your daily life, you should get a hearing test and ENT evaluation.
What are signs of an ear infection in adults?|||Symptoms may include sharp ear pain, fluid drainage, hearing loss, or a feeling of fullness. Fever may or may not be present. If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical help.
What causes frequent nosebleeds and how can I prevent them?|||Frequent nosebleeds can be caused by dry air, nose picking, or underlying medical conditions. Use saline nasal sprays, avoid trauma, and keep the inside of the nose moisturized. Seek medical help if they occur more than twice a week.
My nose feels constantly blocked. What could be the cause?|||Chronic nasal congestion can result from allergies, sinusitis, or a deviated septum. Using antihistamines or nasal sprays may help, but if symptoms last more than two weeks, consult an ENT specialist.
I lost my sense of smell. What should I do?|||Loss of smell (anosmia) can be due to viral infections, sinus issues, or nasal polyps. You should be examined by a doctor, especially if the problem persists beyond two weeks.
I have post-nasal drip. How do I manage it?|||Post-nasal drip can be managed by staying hydrated, using saline nasal rinses, and treating underlying allergies or infections. If symptoms persist, an ENT consultation is advised.
My throat hurts but I don’t have a fever. Do I need antibiotics?|||Not necessarily. Most sore throats without fever are viral and improve with warm fluids, saltwater gargles, and rest. Antibiotics are only prescribed if bacterial infection is confirmed.
I feel like something is stuck in my throat. Is it serious?|||This could be due to acid reflux, muscle tension, or a lodged object. If the feeling persists or you experience difficulty swallowing or breathing, seek medical attention immediately.
I have a hoarse voice for over two weeks. What should I do?|||Persistent hoarseness may be due to vocal strain, infections, or issues with the vocal cords. It should be evaluated by an ENT specialist if it lasts more than 2 weeks.
I keep coughing at night. Could it be related to my throat?|||Yes. Chronic cough can be due to post-nasal drip or laryngopharyngeal reflux. Elevating your head during sleep and avoiding spicy or acidic foods can help. A specialist can determine the exact cause.
When should I see an ENT doctor instead of a general physician?|||If you have persistent symptoms involving your ears, nose, or throat for more than 1–2 weeks, or if your symptoms worsen despite treatment, it's time to consult an ENT specialist.
Can allergies cause both nasal congestion and throat irritation?|||Yes. Allergic rhinitis can lead to nasal blockage, post-nasal drip, and a scratchy throat. Treating the allergy with antihistamines, nasal sprays, and avoiding triggers often relieves both issues.
